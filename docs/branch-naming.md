## Branch Naming Rules

All branch names must match the following regular expression:

```
^(master|develop|(feat|bugfix|hotfix|chore|refactor|docs|style|test|perf|ci|build|revert|release)\/[-.0-9_a-z]+)$
```

## Enforcement

Branch names are validated by a CI/CD pipeline using regular expression checks. Branches that do not comply will fail automated checks and cannot be merged.
